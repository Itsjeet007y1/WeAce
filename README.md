I have decided to assign the following weights to each factor:

Job satisfaction: 30%
Salary and benefits: 20%
Work-life balance: 20%
Management: 20%
Opportunities for growth and development: 10%

Scoring the factors:
Here are the scores that employees give for each factor:

Job satisfaction: 8.5
Salary and benefits: 7.0
Work-life balance: 7.5
Management: 8.0
Opportunities for growth and development: 9.0

Calculation of the employee satisfaction index:
To calculate the employee satisfaction index, we multiply each factor score by its weight and sum the results:

Employee satisfaction index = (8.5 * 0.30) + (7.0 * 0.20) + (7.5 * 0.20) + (8.0 * 0.20) + (9.0 * 0.10)
Employee satisfaction index = 2.55 + 1.40 + 1.50 + 1.60 + 0.90
Employee satisfaction index = 7.45

So the employee satisfaction index is 7.45, which can be interpreted as a moderately high level of employee satisfaction.
